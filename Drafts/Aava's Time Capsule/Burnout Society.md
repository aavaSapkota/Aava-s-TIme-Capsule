#### Book Review by Chapter: 
Neuronal Power 
- While previously the world operated in a immunological way, shunning and eradicating anything that was considered *other*, now we have shifted to a world of excess. This can be seen in our constant and perpetual consumption and are revealed in the mental illness epidemics we see today.  
- This constant influx of content and stimulus is what is contributing to the lack of peace of mind that I feel many seem to experience now. 
- The luxury of logging off from all sources of electronic stimuli is saved for the ultra rich and powerful. 

Beyond Disciplinary Society
- Similarly while in the past our societies operated in a immunological system, our current outlook on work and culture has evolved from a Disciplinary Society to one of individual responsibility and self motivation. 
- Instead of factories and work places disciplining people for doing the wrong thing, Work places encourage individuals to work on improving themselves to better their own situations. The motivation to do works goes from doing wrong to doing well, and the enforcer is moved from the master to the worker. This makes the worker both master and slave to the work they produce. 

Profound Boredom 
- Along the lines of excess in society, it is noted that in the world we live today, we are perpetually bombarded with new content. We are perpetually given new information and media to consume without any time or room to simply exist and be bored. There is always something to quench our thirst for entertainment and consumption. 
- This state of living brings us back to the state of animals. We are nothing but *animal labourans* simply living in constant attention, incapable of simply sitting and contemplating.
- However, it is argued that it is in our state of boredom that true human innovation exists. Only with time for deep aimless contemplation are new ideas formed. It is in this state that our minds are completely boundless and are capable are seeing beyond what is there. 
	- If you stare at a wall hard enough and for long enough, do you see shapes?
	- When you stare at the waves long enough, do you feel yourself moving? 

Vita Activia
- The human condition work is critiqued and rebuttled that it is not necesarrily in our nature etc.  

#### My Experience with Burnout 

We all fall to the illusion of indestructibility as young adults. 

I think we talk about the physical limits we pushed ourselves to on those late nights out, and the unfortunate consequences that followed, but the secret struggles of school and burnout are far less discussed. 

It's great working hard, and playing hard, but what happens when your passion and work seem to merge?

I can never tell when my passion turns into dread. My life's emotions seem to perpetually fluctuate between uncontrivable rage or joy, to pure indifference.

I reached my limit this past year, and then decided to go beyond. I was constantly trying to get involved with these organizing gigs, and giving my all to each. It's easy to push yourself when someone else is relying on you.

This was the play by play of the events that lead to my burnout, and perhaps mild depression: 

Last summer, I was first indoctrinated as a Summer 24 host by Anson and Joss. Until this point I had been already taking it pretty chill overall, and my most important role had been doing social rep and stuff. I had been so excited to take on this position because I knew I wanted to become more engaged and involved in Socratica, and having that opportunity really helped me get out of bed in general. To be frank, looking back a lot of thinks worked out for me because I continued to come to Socratica. It didn't feel incredible, but most of the small steps I took were started in those sessions. 

Flash forward to 1B term itself. School wise it was a pretty chill term. I did a lot of stuff, I went to Collision which was a blast, we continued to work on our side project which was really nice, and I was hosting socratica sessions. Also, after my hack the north organizer application, I decided to reapply as a volunteer lead, and committed to that position. To be honestly by the end I was already feeling pretty exhausted, but so was everyone else, it was finals season, so it made sense. When the opportunity to be a co-chair for Socratica Symposium came up, I jumped at the opportunity. I knew I wanted to experience this at least once, and I'm very glad I did. The problem was what came after. 

After Socratica Symposium, I was thrown into finals season. It was pretty brutal but, I did make it through it relatively unscathed. However, instead of taking a solid break after ward... I decided to make good on my promise to do work during the school term and do some work for the TagLab. Specifically I agreed to do a Systematic Analysis, which I later got confirmed, is one of the most fucking brutal papers to write, with the review process just as extensive. I had to read 50 papers in about 2 weeks, and tbh ur girl was kinda out of her reading era, but I did go back into it for this, which was crazy. The weekend I got back, it was Kelly's birthday, and I decided I would have one hot girl weekend, and then spend the rest of the week grinding out the papers. By the end, I had only gone through 20, with my inefficient reading and my undiagnosed adhd not helping, I really did try my best, and it is fair to say I did not do much exercise during this time. By the time co-op was coming around, I was already tired. But going from my experience at ecobee, I thought, it would be a pretty chill experience at the beginning, with everything just starting at onboarding. However this was when my earlier commitment of volunteer lead started to creep in. During the summer, it was quite chill, and really fun! With the summer retreat starting, I felt like I was having a lot of fun being in the team, however, with Binal in Italy, I suddenly felt an intense need to step up being in Waterloo, and help her coordinate. Things gradually picked up coming into the first week of September, and finally exploded The weekend of Volunteer Training. 

September 9th - 10th, I ran volunteer training with my fellow Volunteer Leads, and as the Volunteer Leads in charge of it, I was the go to person on that day. I had people continuously coming up to me telling me I looked like my hair was on fire, and quite frankly, it was. The first day, I felt such an intense panic and was running around, however, all things considered, it ran extremely smoothly. However, when we looked at our numbers after the first day. We had a bit of a jump scare. Being the irratible, parinoid person I am, I took this as a panic sign and then decided, instead of doing a written explaination to binal, I would stay up, until 2AM, very exhausted, and just call her from italy and update her verbally cause I just physically could not text and I needed to talk to her. 

Side note: I don't know why I have such an intense aversion to the written word sometimes. I think it has something to do with the way I like hearing myself talk. It's true, I know it's true. But even more than that, I hate even doing the voice recording things. It feels like I'm talking to a computer, which I kind of am, but whatever. The only time I really like writing is when I type because, I feel it's more intense. Like I feel my fingers moving on the keyboard much more, rather than over tiring out my thumbs. 

back to that night. so after volunteer training at 11:00pm, I decided to go straight to Arnav's party. I will admit, it was really fun seeing everyone again and it was  a great reunion, and I don't regret it at all. I felt relieved to talk to binal and debrief her. The next day, the volunteer training went quite smoothly, but i was still exhausted. The next day, after work, I bused back to toronto after a long day of work. 

My mother said the
