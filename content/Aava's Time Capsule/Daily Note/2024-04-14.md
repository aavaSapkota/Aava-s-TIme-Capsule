Today has been interesting: 
- I got a 50 on my physics test 
- I have a final in 2 days
- i got a date maybe for next tuesday... 
- i don't have contacts for said date which is sorta problematic... wtever... 
- i feel anxious about the date but don't really care about my contacts 
- also i think i've already annoyed my friends about the date too much so i'm going to cease with the updates until end of week. 

I broke, i googled aries with capricorn man. It's over for me. this is going to end badly WOMP, plenty of fish in the sea!! i will be finishing my eng homework now. oh dear. ALso matched with a cute girl, YAY 

BRO THIS SHIT WENT SO BAD OMG HOLY SHIT. Well, we live we learn...
