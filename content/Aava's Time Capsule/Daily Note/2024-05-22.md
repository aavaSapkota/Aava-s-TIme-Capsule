I feel anxious right now. I think I'm talking too much. Arnav asked me for intros to PM people 
which i do have and am getting but i also told him about socratica, and i was kinda spamming him on it idk, i feel kinda bad about doing that and feel like i represented it bad. I at the same time don't know if I want to interact with arnav like this anymore, hearing how sofia described their intereactions and friendships. AHHHH i'm blowing it up for nothing. Still don't have a search bar.
