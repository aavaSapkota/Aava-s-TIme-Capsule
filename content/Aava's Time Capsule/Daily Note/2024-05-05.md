At Douze a Deux, and my head hurts from decision fatigue. So I'm going to make a list of things that I actively want to do in general and then prioritize so I can get through everything. 

| Project                                 | Level of Want to do Now | Priority/Date Due |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Make the nanobots from big hero six     | Low                     | Wednesday         |
| Waterloo Nepali Club Logo and planning  | Low                     | N/A               |
| Fix Socratica Website                   | Medium                  | N/A               |
| Take pictures of spaces in Douze a Deux | Medium                  | Today.            |

Ok so from evaluating the priority of these, I will start my research of the nanobots today, and then during the break I'll walk around the rooms and take photos, of the space which I will compile into a report of learnings for our team in Waterloo. as well as ideas of product tracking etc. 


- Start research 
- take photos during the break 
- make a fun report document outlining everything

Discovery: I like making documents
