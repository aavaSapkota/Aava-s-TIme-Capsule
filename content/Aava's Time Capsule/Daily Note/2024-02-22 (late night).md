Today I woke up late, and I went to ACE Hotel for the day. 

In the morning I started my rewatch of One Day. I marvel at how I can rewatch a show and still feel the emotions I felt. 

To be so for real, I think the reason I like this show so much is because it validates the fantasy a lot of girls like me had with their friendships. DISCLAIMER, the really long friendships I have or the serious ones, I have never felt the emotions of this show, but the less serious, I can admit, I've wondered. 

I think the mastery of music is what brings film to the level that it is. I listen to these songs while I'm on the bus and can't help but feel as though I'm falling in love with the world around me. Funny how that works. I think I can be in love, and quite frankly, I think if I keep down the road I'm going... actually I have no idea. 

I am so fucking happy I'm an empath. I feel like watching other in love, I get it for myself. I think the feeling that I've manifested as love, is something I could maybe be content feeling myself. I think I've been in love before, or whatever version I created of it. I think I can manifest that now, and I think I'm happy with that. 


But anyways. Today I went to ACE with Sani, it was fun, ate dumplings. I'm so fucked for midterms, I can't study and project is not projecting. but whatever. 

I could rewatch this fucking show 100 times. Everything is perfect. The pacing, the music, the actors. Holy fuck the actors. Emma and Dex were casted spot on. Dex is still lowkey annoying but I think that's the point. Also they're actual chemistry is insane. AND THE STRUCTURE. UGH. SO FUCKING GOOD. 

Hot take... Dexter at the end is the perfect man for an ambitious woman. Am I... Dexter...
