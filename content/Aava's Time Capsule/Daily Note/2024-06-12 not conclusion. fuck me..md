Last night I had an extremely vivid dream. For some reason, sumedh was at my house, and it seemed to be under the air of awkward convenience. I had already confessed to him by this point, and I guess we stayed friends. I walked into the kitchen and I think he was making chicken breast or smth. I saw my white sweater with embroidered marks and as I read the words, they seemed to be inside jokes, which was strange because I don't really have many with him. And upon further recollection, I don't know if it was his face. I can never seem to remeber his face exactly. Not even his voice. I think that I simply deeply crave this other romantic connection, and feel unsure of how to attain a fulfilling one. While ironically I'm told not to go searching. If I could have a guarantee with him I would probably wait, but I know that's not true. I think in truth, I simply search for this in anyone, but had convined myself it was him. This is an interesting premise to write on though I think. 

The idea of being connected by prophecy and dream. and for it all to lead into dellusion. I think I just need to be more present, and stop analyzing my feelings.
