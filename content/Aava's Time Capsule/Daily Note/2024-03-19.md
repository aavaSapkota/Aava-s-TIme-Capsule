Woke up feeling very anxious, because I am feeling quite behind in my work. It's 10:41, and I'm still feeling it, but, not as bad as before I think. I need to meditate for a bit I think, I will do this at lunch when I go home. 

I opened up Linkedin to a job opportunity today, idk if it's a scam but I asked the guy for more information. I really want to do stuff abroad, but, need to be careful. Still exciting. Then I saw this post about Security Pal, and how they're naming Kathmandu's tech hub as ["Silicon Peaks"](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7175773113790439424/)


11:56: felt better, back to anxiety.
