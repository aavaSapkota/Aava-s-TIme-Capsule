My almost 2 year long Delusion has now been confronted. It went as well as I would have expected. A rejection. The sort that I'm quite familiar with. He was polite, ensured it wasn't about me, and that he just needed time. But, even though I know he was going through something. There seemed to be something in his eyes that revealed another partial truth. It was also me. 

Looking back on this excursion, I've discovered a new emotional paradigm new to me. The emotional big think. 

These are the thoughts racing through my head: 
- maybe he'll text me in the middle of the night and cave. Maybe he'll call me over to his house to hook up 
- maybe he's telling his friends about this, and shaking his head in pity or of confusion 
- maybe he still somewhat might like me. does he even see me like that? 
- The look of Intrigue has gone away. I saw in his eyes his intent, he had done this before, and was comfortable with the rejection. I don't know if he wants to even stay friends tho. I'm going to not text him for the next little bit. 

- During the date, I had a moment where I thought he's not that cute. Acc he's less than cute. Acc, what the fuck, am I doing. What have i been doing. 
- Then he told me he had a younger sister. And idk my heart swelled a bit. I was actually scared that he was an only child. I feel like he makes more sense to me now, but he's still toxic as fuck probably. I don't know. 
- I'm sad. I wanted him to like me. I wanted him to hold me or just hold my hand maybe. I wanted him to look at me more. We were both kinda staring out into the darkness. I also didn't know what I was doing. I set the walk in an awkward direction and I feel bad for that, but at the same time idk. 
- It's over i want it to be over, but it's not. but it almost is. But it is. But i don't know. 

But we should definitely be friends. I don't know if I can be friends rn. Whatever I guess. I feel sad regardless. 

He's not gonna text me back. He doesn't feel the same way.
