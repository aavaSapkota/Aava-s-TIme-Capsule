Omg, i feel so hype rn. Just talked to Ashish dada, and he said he's working on VR product at Meta. This is fucking perfect. If I work hard and play my cards right, I can maybe get to where I need to be by next co-op. I need to keep my head up high and not get too excited. I need to be mindful of myself and how I carry myself with myself and friends. 

It is Pristina's birthday tomorrow, I need to wish her happy birthday, and maybe bring her a bubble tea or smth. I just want her to know that even though we have majorly drifted, I want to give her a little token of appreciation for her birthday. We might not be the bestest friend, but I think I still want her in my life. 

I need to go and get diagnosed for anxiety. Because I'm realizing that the random peace when I get drunk, should not happen when I'm drunk/tipsy. It should happen when I'm sober. I need to take more control of this. 

I have so many opportunities hurling my way. I cannot loose out on this. I need to lock in, and write more i think. just to record my thoughts and experiences.

I also need to plan my 20th in a way that is productive and not too loud, cause I think it's fine to be selfish for one day but you can't be selfish everyday. And even still, don't be a bitch about it. Call you mom today again, I kinda rushed her this morning cause I didn't feel like talking and what not.
