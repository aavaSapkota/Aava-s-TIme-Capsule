I like listening to albums while reading their lyrics. It's an intimate way of consuming an artistic medium. I know I don't know these people, but when you listen to their song, you can't help but hear their vulnerabilities and humors in the melodies. I feel like I react as I listen to music a lot... it looks really weird in public, but for me, it's the same if a friend told me some dumb hot take that became a song, and it's just funny. 

I like the shorter form songs, just because it feels like little voice messages of brain dumps on a specific topic, and they're really nice. 

Dominic Fike has been really consuming my listening experience. Favorite tracks: 
- Cancel Me - reminds me of my friends who say the most fucking out of pocket shit, half for the reaction value and half dropping their filter a bit. It's refreshing, nobody has perfect takes. 
- Why - this felt personal. I felt i was being called out for my toxic work mentality and.. yeah fuck you Mr.Fike, i physically cringed at that one verse. 



Verses that make me physically cringe: 
- Dominic Fike: 3 Nights: 
	- "I can't make you call or make you stay, Or take you off the pedestal, so I get lost in modern music, watching movies, talking to the walls in my room, walking through the halls in my head, just tryna make sure it all makes sense": Every person in a situationship at some point ever.


Every experience you've had, someone else can relate to. That doesn't make you unoriginal, that gives you a partner in crime who's felt the same things as you have. 

I like stating the obvious, because sometimes I forget the obvious.

- "yeah we were something-- to bad we were children" - Before
