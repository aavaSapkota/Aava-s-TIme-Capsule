Reaching a new decade can feel like another nail in the coffin. As my birthday messages would reflect, the common, "you're ancient" was a recurring theme. Instead, as these months have gone by, I feel as though I've been hit with the realization of how young I really am. The past 10 years feel like the prelude to my story. Foundational, but almost irrelevent. They have brought me to this new starting point where I've been reunited with all the figures of my past, as is the typical experience of a GTA kid going to Waterloo. 

Why 20 and not the start of university? I firmly belive everyone loses their mind in first year. The buzz of novelty and excitement in the air is enough to cloud the judgement of anyone. Instead everyone is teleported back to Kindergarten, where the simple question, "Do you want to be friends?" will lead you down a 6 month spiral questioning your compatibility with these new members of your social circle. Like Kindergarten, we have lots of fond memories of this time, but no real experiences we'll have again (when did you last pretend to cook in a play kitchen??). It is second year, when you move out of residence, that you really begin. When the friendships are tested by an additional 10 minute walk, and school, and work, and life. 

But enough rambling. Why am I even making this post? I vivdely remeber reaching my 19th birthday, and beyond the promise of buying my first drink legally, I started to feel a sudden dread. The end of my teen years. What did that even mean? I remebered turning from 18 to 19, and feeling the exact same way. I feel like your new age dosen't hit you until a couple months down the line. Either way, the existential feeling of almost completing a decade hit, and then it hit me. This. I was just about to reach the best decade of my life. The decade everyone tries to relive. I couldn't go into it without a plan?!? How would I know what I needed to do? I wasn't a stupid kid anymore, I am currently a full fledged adult, financially independent (as broke as I am), and completely capable of planing out the most epic decade ever! 

It wasn't until tonight (October 5th, 2024), after my walk with my roommate Medha (hi medhs), that it hit me. I have this constant urge to explain my life story to people. Not because, I think it's remarkably interesting (although sometimes it is), or because they asked to hear it (not many people do...), but because I think, if people could see what I was thinking-- if they thought it too, we could connect better, and maybe they would emphathize with my story and tell me their's. I feel my whole life has been finding ways to connect with people, and sometimes, it's crazy how much you can connect with a random stranger. I want to provide the sense of connection to the strangers reading this. Because sometimes, it can errupt a new passion or enthusiasum in you that sometimes you forget to see in the people you know. 

The point of this post is to share some of my fond moments and lessons learned from my prelude to go into my main series, a little context for the people just tuning in. 



## Early Life

As I reflect quietly to myself, I realized that while the plan itself has been changed at each milestone, my general direction and tradjectory has been going with my general intention. Granted, I've earned a few therapy sessions of trauma in the process, but the life I've lived so far, feels quite accomplished all things considered. 

Even when I was younger I tried to map out my life... I wandered off each path. When you're 10, life doesn't really exist beyond the vague notion of high school. I thought, after Hillmount, I would go onto the the home middle school Highland, and then the final destination: A.Y.. My plans changed in grade 6 when I was put into the gifted program. Suddendly there was a slight hitch in my plan, instead of straight to A.Y. I was off to Zion Heights the middle school with the gifted program. It looked like a prison. When I entered middle school, I was suddenly introduced to the idea of specialized programs for Highschool. Suddenly everyone was rushing to gain the extracurriculars for these programs, and ensure their grades were high enough for admittance. In grade 8, the dreaded entrance exams approached. I took the 


I remember when I was in grade 5, the second time I took the gifted test, I was faced with a jarring reality of leaving my friends behind to go to another class. Even in elementary school we have developed a strange tribalism separating gifted kids from non-gifted kids. I couldn't speak for the other years, but our class of grade 5s felt quite split.

























 

~~At first I didn't want to take the test again. I thought, why take it again when I already have friends in my other class? In the end, I took it after much convincing from my parents, and to my surprise, I passed**. This was the first time I was faced with making a decision that would change the trajectory of my future. I knew if I chose to go into the gifted program, I would be going to a different middle school than my elementary school friends. That scared me a lot, but in the end I rationalized it with the idea that at least I would be going to the same high school as them.~~ 

~~So I went to the gifted class, and went to Zion instead of Highland, but I did not go to AY Jackson. Along the way, I became good friends with my classmates, and got swept into their academic furry. Going into middle school I was introduced to specialized high school STEM programs, one of which I had applied to and later attended.~~

~~The reason I share this story, is because of how my small feeling of adventure and novelty, changed my life course. I can't say I wouldn't have ended up at waterloo if I went to AY Jackson, but I know I would be coming in as a completely different person.~~ 


^^ i feel triggered and demotivated and kinda distracted after writing this. I should avoid talking or thinking about this phase outside of therapy, because it's starting to become a point for a lot of mental strain that i did not process. 












\* I was supposed to write this before March 30th of this year... but I'm always late, so here it is .... months after instead! 

\** i don't like this word.. more like they thought i was a good fit for the class.
