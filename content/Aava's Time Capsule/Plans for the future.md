My life right now: 

- Every morning I wake up feeling an intense panic to turn off my alarm so that I don't disturb my friends. I jerk awake in bed and almost immediately turn it off and go back to bed.
- Leads to a day of un productivity 

Things I want to do/be: 

- Personality: 
	- I want to stop complaining and feeling like I'm not good enough again. I'm back in my middle school mentality and it sucks. 
		- Solution: Practice genuine gratitude. Remember how lucky you have it in silence, or post on ur website if you feel like sharing it. 
	- I want to stop feeling so in capacitated with my new ideas. I want to feel the confidence to purse them or at least fall on my face trying. 
	- Literally anxiety or what I perceive it to be messes so much stuff up, maybe getting help on that, or being more serious in targeting that. 

This summer: A day outlined 
- I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the bathroom and wash my face, get my yoga mat and go upstairs to the yoga room and do my silpa-setty yoga routine. Take celeste. 
- Come back downstairs, make a breakfast smoothie 
	- bananas, frozen strawberries etc. 
		- buy almost rotting fruit from st.jacobs and store in freezer 
- Go to work 
- Work all day :D 

- After work run! 
- Evening project work time <3
	- make a robot. figure out the rst. 
- Journal as often as possible.
