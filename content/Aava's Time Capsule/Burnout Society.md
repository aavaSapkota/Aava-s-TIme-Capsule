#### Book Review by Chapter: 
Neuronal Power 
- While previously the world operated in a immunological way, shunning and eradicating anything that was considered *other*, now we have shifted to a world of excess. This can be seen in our constant and perpetual consumption and are revealed in the mental illness epidemics we see today.  
- This constant influx of content and stimulus is what is contributing to the lack of peace of mind that I feel many seem to experience now. 
- The luxury of logging off from all sources of electronic stimuli is saved for the ultra rich and powerful. 

Beyond Disciplinary Society
- Similarly while in the past our societies operated in a immunological system, our current outlook on work and culture has evolved from a Disciplinary Society to one of individual responsibility and self motivation. 
- Instead of factories and work places disciplining people for doing the wrong thing, Work places encourage individuals to work on improving themselves to better their own situations. The motivation to do works goes from doing wrong to doing well, and the enforcer is moved from the master to the worker. This makes the worker both master and slave to the work they produce. 

Profound Boredom 
- Along the lines of excess in society, it is noted that in the world we live today, we are perpetually bombarded with new content. We are perpetually given new information and media to consume without any time or room to simply exist and be bored. There is always something to quench our thirst for entertainment and consumption. 
- This state of living brings us back to the state of animals. We are nothing but *animal labourans* simply living in constant attention, incapable of simply sitting and contemplating.
- However, it is argued that it is in our state of boredom that true human innovation exists. Only with time for deep aimless contemplation are new ideas formed. It is in this state that our minds are completely boundless and are capable are seeing beyond what is there. 
	- If you stare at a wall hard enough and for long enough, do you see shapes?
	- When you stare at the waves long enough, do you feel yourself moving? 

Vita Activia
- The human condition work is critiqued and rebuttled that it is not necesarrily in our nature etc.  

#### My Experience with Burnout 

We all fall to the illusion of indestructibility as young adults. Whether it's nursing a sprained ankle the next day after a night out, or the sinking feeling in the middle of a test when you forget how to answer a question you did the day before, because you crammed all night. However, beyond binge drinking till 3 am with high school friends, we sometimes forget our minds follow this same principal. While this is the time for hard work, unsustainable hard work can have a much greater toll. 

I think we talk about the physical limits we pushed ourselves to on those late nights out, and the unfortunate consequences that followed, but the secret struggles of school and burnout are far less discussed. 

It's great working hard, and playing hard, but what happens when your passion and work seem to merge? 


I can never tell when my passion turns into dread. My life's emotions seem to perpetually fluctuate between uncontrivable rage or joy, to pure indifference.
