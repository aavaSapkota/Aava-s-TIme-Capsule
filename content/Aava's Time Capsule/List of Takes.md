One Day - Follows two friends and portrays the chapters of their lives on July 15th, every year after they graduate from college. One is a stuck up writer with a curt attitude, and the other a posh school boy without any real concept of the real world. 

I wonder what I'll be when I'm an adult. like a real adult. What type of person do I want to be? 

I remember my earlier school days. I was so stuck up. I had an outlandish take that if I wanted to be smart I had to be somewhat ugly. Now, I know this is not true, and yet, I feel stuck getting out of this transition. I want to be smart I think, but I also want to learn. I think the problem with how I go about my self, is I'm not acting on things based on reality. 

I want to learn. I want to love, but I need to be ambitious. And enjoy my life while I have it.
