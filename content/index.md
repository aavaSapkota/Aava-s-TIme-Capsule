Thanks for stoping by my little corner of the internet! I like to to use this space as both a showcase of my work and a time capsule of my thoughts. I find myself feeling perpetually reminicent on the past projects and and experiences I've had, and wanted a central place to showcase them ~ all with a bit of inner monologe.
