title: Hey there 👋
---

Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet! I like to to use this space as both a showcase of my work and a time capsule of my thoughts. I find myself feeling perpetually reminiscent on the past projects and and experiences I've had, and wanted a central place to showcase them ~ all with a bit of inner monologue. 

# Let me introduce myself... ☀️

If we haven't met yet, hi! I'm Aava, a 2B Systems Design Engineering Student studying at the University of Waterloo. I operate in the intersection of Older Adults, Creativity, and Software. Self described as a vibe curator, I enjoy creating welcoming and accessible environments, and working towards impactful causes. This decade, I am on my Side Quest Arc and am open to any and all opportunities! I'll post some of my learning on here, so stay tuned...
