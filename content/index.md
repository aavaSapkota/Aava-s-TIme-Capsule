Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet! I like to to use this space as both a showcase of my work and a time capsule of my thoughts. I find myself feeling perpetually reminiscent on the past projects and and experiences I've had, and wanted a central place to showcase them ~ all with a bit of inner monologue. 

### Introduction ‚òÄÔ∏è
